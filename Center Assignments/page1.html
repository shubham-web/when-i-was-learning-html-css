		Bhopal, the Capital of Madhya Pradesh.
	</h1>
	<p>
		Bhopal, the capital of Madhya Pradesh, is a fascinating amalgam of scenic beauty, old historic city and modern urban planning. It is the 11th century city Bhojpal, founded by Raja Bhoj, but the present city was established by an Afghan soldier, Dost Mohammed (1707-1740). His descendants build Bhopal into a beautiful city.

	<h1>
		Bhopal, the city of Lakes.
	</h1>
	<p>
		The two lakes of Bhopal still dominate the city, and are indeed its nucleus. Bordered along their shores stand silent sentinels that testify to the growth of the city.  Bhopal today presents a multi-faceted profile;   the old city with its marketplaces and fine old mosques and palaces still bears the aristocratic imprint of its former rulers, among them the succession of powerful Begums who ruled Bhopal from 1819 to 1926.  Equally impressive is the new city with its verdant, exquisitely laid out parks and gardens, broad avenues and streamlined modern edifices.  It is greener and cleaner than most cities in the country.

	<h1>
		Bhopal, the Dynasties that ruled.
	</h1>
	<p>
		Several dynasties have left their mark on the city. The antediluvian remains of the forts built by the Rajputs, Afghans and the Moguls silently speak of the battles, victories and failures of the past era. These icons are testimony to the grandeur of past and provide a marvelous treat to the eyes. Even by seeing the remains of the city one can have the glimpse of different cultures which existed in the past . Bhopal today is the seat of administration of the state . It carries the abstruseness, the discord, the charm and the dynamism of a city where the past coexists in harmony with the present.
